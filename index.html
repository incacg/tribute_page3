      <h2 id="headline">3 Brilliant Ideas</h2>
      <ul id="tribute-info">
        <li>
          <strong>Wireless Energy</strong> - In 1901, Tesla secured $150,000
          from financier J.P. Morgan to build a 185-foot-tall, mushroom-shaped
          tower on the north shore of Long Island capable of transmitting
          messages, telephony and images to ships at sea and across the Atlantic
          Ocean by using the Earth to conduct signals. As work began on the
          structure, called Wardenclyffe Tower, Tesla wanted to adapt it to
          allow for wireless power delivery, believing from his experiments on
          radio and microwaves that he could light up New York City by
          transmitting millions of volts of electricity through the air. Morgan,
          however, refused to give Tesla any additional funding for his
          grandiose scheme. (Some speculate that Morgan cut off funds once he
          realized that Tesla’s plan would have crippled his other energy-sector
          holdings.) Tesla abandoned the project in 1906 before it could ever
          become operational, and Wardenclyffe Tower was dismantled in 1917.

          <strong>Thought Camera</strong> - Tesla believed it could be possible
          to photograph thoughts. The inspiration came while he was doing
          experiments in 1893, Tesla told a newspaper reporter decades later: “I
          became convinced that a definite image formed in thought must, by
          reflex action, produce a corresponding image on the retina, which
          might possibly be read by suitable apparatus.” The inventor conceived
          of reflecting an image on an artificial retina, taking a photograph
          and projecting the image on a screen. “If this can be done
          successfully, then the objects imagined by a person would be clearly
          reflected on the screen as they are formed,” he said, “and in this way
          every thought of the individual could be read. Our minds would then,
          indeed, be like open books.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Earthquake Machine</strong> - In 1893, Tesla patented a
          steam-powered mechanical oscillator that would vibrate up and down at
          high speeds to generate electricity. Years after patenting his
          invention he told reporters that one day while attempting to tune his
          mechanical oscillator to the vibration of the building housing his New
          York City laboratory, he caused the ground to shake. During the test,
          Tesla continuously turned up the power and heard cracking sounds.
          “Suddenly,” he recalled, “all the heavy machinery in the place was
          flying around. I grabbed a hammer and broke the machine. The building
          would have been down about our ears in another few minutes.” Police
          and ambulances arrived on the scene to attend to the commotion, but
          Tesla told his assistants to remain quiet and tell the police that it
          must have been an earthquake.
